Translate every text in Minecraft to Furrylingo.

Uwuifier is a free and open source mod that seeks to expand the current Minecraft language system by including the popular furry language to all people.  This mod is not intended to be a troll mod but, instead seeks to be a "daily driver". Every day millions of furries suffer from lack of translators, for this reason I have decided to create this mod. 

**Warning: This mod is still on preview and might be incompatible with some other mods! Use it with caution.**
