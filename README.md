## About
Uwuifier is a free and open source mod that seeks to expand the current Minecraft language system by including the popular furry language to all people.

This mod is not intended to be a troll mod but, instead it seeks to be a "daily driver".
Every day millions of furries suffer from lack of translators, for this reason I have decided to create this mod.
